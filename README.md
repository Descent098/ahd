This branch is for the API docs, which are available at [https://kieranwood.ca/ahd](https://kieranwood.ca/ahd).

To rebuild these docs follow these steps:
1. install pdoc3 ```pip install pdoc3```
2. and go to the root directory and run ```pdoc ahd --html``` 
3. Pull the content out of the new ```/html``` folder directly into the root of this branch (should be all html files)
