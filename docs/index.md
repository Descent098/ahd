# ahd; Ad-Hoc Dispatcher

Create ad-hoc commands to be dispatched in their own namespace.



## Why? 

This package seeks to make the tedius task of creating one off bash scripts obsolete. The idea is to write an annoying command once, give it a name, and be able to recall it without an issue. It also has the benefit of namespacing commands that would normally be keywords for ease of use. See the quick-start guide for more details.
